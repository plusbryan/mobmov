					</B>Since this thing had never been done before (that I knew of at least), I pretty much had to start from scratch back in 2004. Here's a short list of all the components of the 2012 MobMov system:
					<ol>
						<li><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00498IPX8/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00498IPX8&linkCode=as2&tag=showbook-20">InFocus IN5122 4000 Lumen</a><br>
							</b>This is a fairly high-end proconsumer projector, that has some unique features that make it well-suited for running mobmovs. Firstly, at 4000 lumens, it's bright enough to compete with street lights. HDMI connection is helpful for connecting to the MacBook. The throw distance is pretty long, which makes it easy to park in the back. The really cool bit is it has a 2x zoom lens, lens-shift, and keystone correction, meaning I can basically point the projector anywhere and adjust it to match the projection &quot;screen&quot;, even if it's on an angle (think of a square image on a hill). This is great because obscure projection surfaces are so much more fun.<br>
							In general, I'm a big fan of InFocus &amp; Epson projectors based on experience. Just choose one with lens shift, zoom, and keystone, with greater than 2000 lumens for the best experience.<br>

							</b>It doesn't really matter what brand - but get a pure sine mode. It'll produce cleaner power, which is important for the life of your projector. I have the 1000W version. I do need to keep my engine running though, to make sure I don't drain my battery (it would die in about an hour). The power wire is run from my battery to below the passenger seat, where the inverter is placed.<br>

								I used to use simple DVD players for the show, but with a lappy, I can produce a more professional show with titles and the like. It consumes a little more power, but it's worth the added production value.<br>

						<li><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002NRIM8/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0002NRIM8&linkCode=as2&tag=showbook-20">Ramsey FM25b transmitter</a><br>
							</b>FM Transmitters, as you can imagine, aren't exactly flying off the shelves. They're expensive and fiddly. This is the best bang for your buck. I got myself the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002QG236/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0002QG236&linkCode=as2&tag=showbook-20">FM100</a> model, which gives you more control and a slightly better audio signal. Both work flawlessly for about 150ft in all directions.
