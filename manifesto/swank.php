									<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Once you have made pre-payment arrangements, we will ship your movies so they arrive at least two days before your show date.&nbsp; If your print has not arrived, you must call Swank Motion Pictures at 1-800-876-5577.&nbsp; Payment of your full rental fee is required if there is no notification to Swank Motion Pictures one (1) business day prior to your show regarding undelivered prints.</font></p>
									<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Any film may be canceled without obligation provided that Swank Motion Pictures receives written notification fourteen (14) days before the film is shipped, or the full rental and handling charges must be paid.&nbsp; All show date changes must be made in writing and received by Swank Motion Pictures ten (10) days before the film is shipped, or the full rental and handling charges must be paid.</font></p>
									<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If your screening is canceled after the movie has already shipped to you, we will allow you to reschedule the same movie within one year of the original show date; you must pay the original invoice and you must pay the cost of shipping for us to send it back out to you.&nbsp; You may not substitute another title.&nbsp; </font></p>
									<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Movies must be returned the first business day after your screening.&nbsp; We will enclose a pre-paid return shipping label with each 16mm, DVD and VHS print; you must use the label enclosed, as we will track the return shipment by this label.&nbsp; If another customer's screening is missed as a result of your late print, you will be charged a late fee.&nbsp; 35mm prints will be picked up by a designated shipping company; you are responsible for making the print available for pickup the first business day after your screening.&nbsp; If the company attempts to pick up a 35mm print and it is not ready, you will be charged $25 for each attempted pickup.</font></p>
